# Statement

Statement is an iOS app focused on user self-improvement through setting daily goals. Users are reminded to set two daily goals each morning, and then asked to judge their performance at the end of the day. The next day the user then sets a new set of goals with their old goals persisted using Core Data and moved to a historical table view.

## Getting Started

Statement does not use any third party frameworks, and so only requires Xcode to run. Clone the repo and open the .xcworkspace file to run.
